Should've, should've, should've
Think about now, all that I would've, could've...
Do you really wanna know the truth?
Truth wasn't really your strong suit
But I won't blame that on our youth
You, everybody calling wanted you
Couldn't really tell you not to do
Just exactly what you wanted to
Because your love was in my life
You know just how to be bad
You know how to go and get me back
With your hands upon my back
Catching all the feelings that we had
Everybody got their vices
Sin don't care about how nice you sound
Everybody got their price
And this is how we all fall down
But, if somebody were to tell me now
That everything we thought was wrong
Everything we loved was wrong
Time after time, I was so blind
But, not gonna lie, it felt alright
When you were mine
Even used to let you wear my clothes
Bring all of your boyfriends home
Swear I'm never drinking no more
We shouldn't be a thing no more
Can't handle the sting no more
I won't be throwing down on the phone no more
Watch you walking out the door no more
Come home to you crying on the floor, no no
No, I can't live with the storms, no more clouds
No more thunder, no no
You know just how to be bad
You know how to go and get me back
With your hands upon my back
Catching all the feelings that we had
I would be you if I could be any creature in this world
I was caught up, but couldn't keep up with you, girl
But, if somebody were to tell me now
That everything you wanted was wrong
Everything you want was wrong
That everything you think you wanted then
Was just figment of your brain
Imagination got you praying
You can save a broken dream
But everything you thought was wrong
Everything you loved
Time after time, I was so blind
But, not gonna lie, it felt alright
When you were mine
